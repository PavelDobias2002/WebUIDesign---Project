### Design Rationale
5. <b>Why did you choose this theme/topic?</b> <br>When we were thinking about the theme for our website, we wanted to choose something we all love and are passionate about. Movies hit that critaria, so we chose them for our theme.

- have a consistent and responsive design and user experience

7. <b>User personas and research insights</b><br>
We have used 3 personas, each within different age group and interests to broaden our reach and make our website more accesible.<br>
During the research we have found design and aesthetic inspirations from other movie themed websites that helped us make the final design work.

### Team Contributions
#### Pavel(PavelDobias2002):
Working with Svelte seemed daunting at first, but after familiarizing myself with the basics I soon learned how powerful tool Svelte is. Now it is hard for me to imagine 
creating website without it. I have worked on:
- News
- News Article
- Reviews with search function<br>
I enjoyed creating the layout and design of each page, following the color pallete of No Signal Media while focusing on easy to use layout.
#### Eliska:<br>
Starting the website was diffucult because of our designs that were lacking precision and clear ideas. Overall the development went well and we managed to agree on layouts and create nice and consistent website. Pages and features I have worked on:
- Home page
- Movies in theaters pages
- suggest new content page
- navigation bar
- card and card2 components
- responsive code for everything I did <br>
I enjoyed this project so much. I learned so many things and I definitely want to learn more and pursue this in the future.

### Deployment Notes
15. <b>Github pages:</b> https://paveldobias2002.github.io/WebUIDesign---Project/
16. <b>Deployment issues and how they were resolved: </b><br>
The main issue while deploying the website to Github Pages was coming back and going through the code to implement the {base} to every src and href. Next time we or I make a website I will implement this troughout the development.<br>
P.S. Make a backup of the build.

### Reflections and Next Steps
17. <b>What went well in the project:</b><br>
The project started strong, with a unique design and color pallete.<br>
Good landing page and consistent pages brought the page together, creating a cohesive site to navigate.
18. <b>What could be improved:</b><br>

19. <b>Suggestions for future development</b><br>
- <b>Pavel:</b><br>
Make backups while building the website and prepare the website for github pages deployment from the start.<br>
Creating a design and layout to follow from the start goes far in development.
- <b>Eliska: Creae proper design and wireframes before the development phase. Improve code structure for later responsivness</b><br>

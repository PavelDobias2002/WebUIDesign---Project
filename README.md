### Design Rationale
"5" When we were thinking about the theme for our website, we wanted to choose something we all love and are passionate about. Movies hit that critaria.
"6" Our goals are:
- entertain and educate users about movies
- aim to provide consistent movie articles and reviews
- have a consistent and responsive design and user experience

"7" We have used 3 personas, each different age group and interests to broaden our reach and make our webiste accesible to them.

### Key Features
"8" List of core pages:
- Homepage with navigation
- Movie calendar
- Submission form for feedback
- News (with one news article page)
- Articles (with one article page)
- Reviews 
- About

"9" Our dynamic elements are:
- Search function in Reviews page
- Burger menu for smaller screens
- Submission form for feedback

"10" All pages are responsive and react to smaller screen using breakpoints.
On smaller screens burger menu appears to make navigation easier.
Lighthouse scored 100 for every aspect except for performance where it scored 84.
We use alt texts to make it easier to use tools such as screen readers.

### Technologies used
- Svelte.js
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Penpot
- Warp
- Github

### Team Contributions
#### Pavel(PavelDobias2002):
Working with Svelte seemed daunting at first, but after familiarizing myself with the basics I soon learned how powerful tool Svelte is. Now it is hard for me to imagine 
creating website without it. I have worked on:
- News
- News Article
- Reviews with search function

### Deployment Notes
"11" Github pages: https://paveldobias2002.github.io/WebUIDesign---Project/
"12" The main issue while deploying the website to Github Pages was coming back and going through the code to implement the {base} to every src and href. Next time we or I make a website I will implement this troughout the development.
I have went through 2 builds

### Reflections and Next Steps
"13" The first hurdle was creating the template for our website. When we had the homepage we were able to go from there, creating the pages and content of the webpage with not much of a problem.
Making the website responsive was a chore, but we used grid layouts that are easy enough to make responsive.
